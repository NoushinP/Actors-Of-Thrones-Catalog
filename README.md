# Actors-Of-Thrones-Catalog

Description:
This project is a user interactive and enterntaining acitvity that is inspired by the Game of Thrones Series.
As a team, we utilized APIs to display the data on the landing page including Characters' full name, image, and the actors' names.
The navigation bar on the top takes the user to more information about the Game of Thrones series.
The main body of the page displays The Shining Stars,
when we click on image of each actor, the real actor's name shows up under the character's name.
Landing page includes a short and fun quiz, 
When on the quiz page, you can continue the questions or go back to the home page.
A footer is displayed at the bottom of the home page including the names of the creators.
